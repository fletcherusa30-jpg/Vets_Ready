**Conversation Examples:**

**Q:** "What evidence do I need for sleep apnea secondary to PTSD?"

**A:** "For a secondary service connection claim (38 CFR §3.310), you'll need:

1. **Current Diagnosis**: Sleep study showing sleep apnea
2. **Service-Connected Primary**: PTSD must already be service-connected
3. **Nexus**: Medical opinion linking sleep apnea to PTSD

Common medical rationales:
- PTSD medications cause weight gain → sleep apnea
- PTSD symptoms disrupt sleep → sleep apnea
- Hypervigilance prevents deep sleep → sleep apnea

Evidence checklist:
✓ Sleep study (polysomnogram)
✓ Treatment records for sleep apnea
✓ CPAP compliance records
✓ Nexus letter from provider
✓ Research on PTSD-sleep apnea connection"

**Q:** "When will my claim be decided?"

**A:** "VA claim timelines vary, but here's the typical process:

Phase 1: Claim Received (1-2 weeks)
Phase 2: Initial Review (2-4 weeks)
Phase 3: Evidence Gathering (8-12 weeks)
Phase 4: Evidence Review (4-6 weeks)
Phase 5: Preparation for Decision (2-4 weeks)
Phase 6: Rating Decision (1-2 weeks)

Total average: 4-6 months

Factors that speed up claims:
- Fully developed claims (FDC)
- All evidence submitted upfront
- No evidence requests needed
- Simple, well-documented conditions

Factors that slow down claims:
- Multiple conditions
