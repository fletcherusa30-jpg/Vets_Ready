## 38 CFR Part 3: Adjudication

**Purpose**: Rules for establishing veteran eligibility and granting VA benefits

### Key Sections

#### 38 CFR 3.303: Establishing Service Connection

**Three Requirements (ALL must be met)**:
1. **Current Medical Diagnosis**: You have a medical condition now
2. **In-Service Event**: Something happened or was wrong during service
3. **Medical Nexus**: Medical evidence shows the service event caused the condition

**Example - Back Pain**:
- Current Diagnosis: ✓ MRI shows herniated disc
- In-Service Event: ✓ Injury documented during military service
- Nexus: ✓ Military doctor states condition caused by service injury

#### 38 CFR 3.309: Presumptive Conditions

**No Nexus Required** - VA presumes service connection if:
- You served during specified time period
- You have the condition

**Common Presumptive Categories**:
- Vietnam Service (Agent Orange): Diabetes, COPD, cancers, heart disease
- Gulf War: Unexplained symptoms, chronic pain, respiratory issues
- Radiation Exposure: Specific cancers
- Combat PTSD: PTSD from imminent personal peril

#### 38 CFR 3.310: Secondary Service Connection

**Causation by Disability**: A condition caused by or aggravated by a service-connected condition

**Example**: Service-connected back pain → Depression from chronic pain → Secondary SC

#### 38 CFR 3.156: Standard of Evidence

**"Preponderance of Evidence"**: More likely than not (>50%)
- Evidence supporting claim must outweigh opposing evidence

#### 38 CFR 3.160: Benefit of the Doubt

**Key Rule**: When evidence is equal, VETERAN WINS
- If evidence split 50/50, VA must decide in your favor

#### 38 CFR 3.103: Duty to Assist

**VA's Obligation**:
- Request military medical records
- Arrange VA examination
- Obtain private medical records (with permission)
- Help obtain evidence

---

## 38 CFR Part 4: Rating Schedule

**Purpose**: Specific rating percentages for each condition

### Rating Methodology

#### Individual Ratings
- Each condition rated separately (10%, 20%, etc.)
- Based on medical criteria in M21-1

#### Combined Ratings Formula
```
Highest Rating + (100 - Highest) × Remaining / 100
Rounded to nearest 10%

Example: 40% + 30%
= 40 + (100-40) × 30 / 100
= 40 + 60 × 0.30
= 40 + 18
= 58% → Rounds to 60%
```

#### Special Ratings

**TDIU (Total Disability Individual Unemployability)**
- Rated as 100% if unable to work
- Requires: Single 60%+ rating OR multiple totaling 70% with one at 40%+

**SMC (Special Monthly Compensation)**
- Additional benefit for specific conditions:
  - Loss of use of limbs
  - Blindness
  - Deafness
  - Need for assistance/attendant care
- Adds to base rating payment

**Aid & Attendance / Housebound**
- Additional benefit if needing daily living assistance or confined to home
- Significantly increases monthly compensation

## Rating Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Single Condition
**Diagnosis**: Service-connected back injury
**Medical Evidence**: Significant pain, range of motion limited
**Rating**: 30% (per M21-1)
**Monthly Payment**: $390 (effective Jan 2025)

### Example 2: Multiple Conditions
**Condition 1**: PTSD rated 50%
**Condition 2**: Tinnitus rated 10%
**Combined Rating Calculation**:
- Start with highest: 50%
- Apply second: 50 + (100-50) × 10 / 100 = 50 + 5 = 55%
- Round to nearest 10%: **60% Combined Rating**

### Example 3: Secondary Service Connection
**Primary**: Service-connected knees (40%)
**Secondary**: Arthritis in knees from service-connected condition (added 20%)
**Combined Rating**:
- 40 + (100-40) × 20 / 100 = 40 + 12 = 52%
- Round: **50% Combined Rating**
