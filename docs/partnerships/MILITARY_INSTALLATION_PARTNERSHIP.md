## 🎯 THE MISSION

### Transition Challenge:
Every year, **200,000+ service members** transition from military to civilian life. Many face:
- **Unemployment or underemployment** - Struggle to translate military skills
- **Identity crisis** - Lost sense of purpose and community
- **Financial stress** - Civilian salary gaps, benefits confusion
- **Resume gaps** - Don't know how to market military experience
- **Network weakness** - Limited civilian professional connections
- **Benefits confusion** - Unaware of VA benefits and GI Bill options

### SFL-TAP Pain Points:
1. **Limited technology** - Outdated or generic career tools
2. **Resource constraints** - Small staff serving thousands
3. **Follow-up difficulty** - Hard to track outcomes post-transition
4. **Employer connections** - Need more veteran-friendly companies
5. **Personalization** - One-size-fits-all doesn't work
6. **Engagement** - Service members need ongoing support, not one workshop

### What Vets Ready Solves:
- Modern, mobile-first platform service members actually use
- MOS-specific job matching and career pathways
- Ongoing support beyond TAP graduation
- Employer network actively recruiting veterans
- Data-driven insights to improve programs
- Seamless handoff to civilian veteran services
