# Root Documentation Index (Post-Cleanup)

To reduce clutter in the repository root, several documentation files are being consolidated under `docs/root/`.

## Moved
- [docs/root/FILE_MANIFEST.md](docs/root/FILE_MANIFEST.md)
- [docs/root/QUICK_START.md](docs/root/QUICK_START.md)

## Pending Moves
The following files will be moved after verification (content and links):
- BUILD_VALIDATION.md
- BUILD-COMPLETE.md
- COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
- DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
- EXECUTION_COMPLETE.md
- EXECUTION-SUMMARY.md
- OPERATIONAL_AUDIT.md
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- rally_forge_COMPLETE.md
- rally_forge_REBRAND_REPORT.md
- rally_forge_REBRAND.md

If any downstream tooling references the old paths, please update those references to point to `docs/root/`.
