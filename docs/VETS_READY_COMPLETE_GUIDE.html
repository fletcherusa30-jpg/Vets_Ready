2. <strong>In-Service Event</strong> - Service records, buddy statements
3. <strong>Nexus</strong> - Medical opinion linking #1 and #2

<h3>Claim Readiness Checklist</h3>

<h3>Rating Education</h3>

<strong>Understanding Disability Ratings:</strong>
- Ratings from 0% to 100% in 10% increments
- Based on 38 CFR Part 4 diagnostic codes
- Severity determines percentage
- Multiple conditions combine using "VA Math"

<strong>Common Rating Levels:</strong>
- <strong>10%:</strong> Mild symptoms, occasional flare-ups
- <strong>30%:</strong> Moderate symptoms, regular impact
- <strong>50%:</strong> Severe symptoms, occupational impairment
- <strong>70%:</strong> Very severe, major life impact
- <strong>100%:</strong> Total occupational and social impairment

<strong>Special Ratings:</strong>
- <strong>TDIU:</strong> Total Disability Individual Unemployability (scheduler at 70%+ but can't work)
- <strong>P&T:</strong> Permanent and Total (100% not expected to improve)
- <strong>SMC:</strong> Additional compensation for severe disabilities

<h3>Evidence Mapping</h3>

<strong>Sample Output:</strong>
</code>`<code>
Claim Strategy for: John Doe

Estimated Combined Rating: 70-90%
</code>`<code>

<strong>Conversation Examples:</strong>

<strong>Q:</strong> "What evidence do I need for sleep apnea secondary to PTSD?"

<strong>A:</strong> "For a secondary service connection claim (38 CFR §3.310), you'll need:

1. <strong>Current Diagnosis</strong>: Sleep study showing sleep apnea
2. <strong>Service-Connected Primary</strong>: PTSD must already be service-connected
3. <strong>Nexus</strong>: Medical opinion linking sleep apnea to PTSD

Common medical rationales:
- PTSD medications cause weight gain → sleep apnea
- PTSD symptoms disrupt sleep → sleep apnea
- Hypervigilance prevents deep sleep → sleep apnea

Evidence checklist:
✓ Sleep study (polysomnogram)
✓ Treatment records for sleep apnea
✓ CPAP compliance records
✓ Nexus letter from provider
✓ Research on PTSD-sleep apnea connection"

<strong>Q:</strong> "When will my claim be decided?"

<strong>A:</strong> "VA claim timelines vary, but here's the typical process:

Phase 1: Claim Received (1-2 weeks)
Phase 2: Initial Review (2-4 weeks)
Phase 3: Evidence Gathering (8-12 weeks)
Phase 4: Evidence Review (4-6 weeks)
Phase 5: Preparation for Decision (2-4 weeks)
Phase 6: Rating Decision (1-2 weeks)

Total average: 4-6 months

Factors that speed up claims:
- Fully developed claims (FDC)
- All evidence submitted upfront
- No evidence requests needed
- Simple, well-documented conditions

Factors that slow down claims:
- Multiple conditions
- Complex medical evidence
- Evidence gathering delays
- C&P exam scheduling
