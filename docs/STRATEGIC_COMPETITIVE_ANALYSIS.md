**Action**:
Create comparison table on homepage:

| Feature | rallyforge | Attorneys | VSOs | Claim Services |
|---------|-----------|-----------|------|----------------|
| **Cost** | $50/year | $3,000-$10,000 | Free | $500-$5,000 |

---

#### 2. **Create "Do I Need an Attorney?" Decision Tree**

**Purpose**: Help veterans self-assess if they can DIY or need professional help

**Tool Location**: New page at `/assessment/legal-help`

**Decision Flowchart**:

```
START → Is this your first VA claim?
  ├─ YES → Use rallyforge Free Tools (DIY possible)
  └─ NO → Was your claim denied?
       ├─ NO → Use rallyforge (claim in progress)
       └─ YES → How long ago?
            ├─ < 1 year → Supplemental claim (rallyforge can help)
            └─ > 1 year → BVA Appeal → Consult attorney
                                      ├─ Complex legal issue? → Attorney
                                      └─ New evidence? → VSO or rallyforge
```

**Output**:
- "You can likely DIY with rallyforge" → Show free tier
- "Consider a VSO (free)" → Show VSO locator
- "You may benefit from an attorney" → Show partner attorney directory

**Value**: Builds trust by being honest about when veterans DON'T need to pay us

---

#### 3. **Add "Success Stories" Section**

**Purpose**: Social proof that our tools work

**Content** (4-6 anonymized case studies):

**Example 1**:
> "Marine Corps Veteran - Used rallyforge to identify 8 secondary conditions"
> - Original claim: 30% for knee injury
> - After rallyforge: Added sleep apnea (secondary), migraines (secondary), back pain (secondary)
> - New rating: 70%
> - Back pay: $28,000
> - Cost: $50/year subscription
> - **ROI**: 560x return on investment

**Example 2**:
> "Army Veteran - Found $18,000 in missed benefits"
> - Used Benefits Matrix tool
> - Discovered: State property tax exemption ($1,500/year), Chapter 35 education for dependents, CHAMPVA for spouse
> - **Total Value**: $18,000+ over 10 years

**Placement**: Homepage, Benefits page, Wizard page

---

#### 4. **Create VSO Partnership Landing Page**

**URL**: `/partnerships/vso`

**Purpose**: Convert VSOs into white-label partners

**Content**:
- **Headline**: "Serve 10X More Veterans With AI-Powered Tools"
- **Problem**: Your reps are drowning in 500+ member caseloads
- **Solution**: rallyforge handles claim prep, you handle filing
- **Pricing**: FREE for core tools, $15/month for premium features per rep
- **CTA**: "Schedule 30-minute demo"

---

#### 5. **Add "Why Not Just Use a VSO?" FAQ**

**Location**: FAQ page, homepage

**Honest Answer**:
> **VSOs are excellent—and FREE. We recommend using them!**
>
> Here's how rallyforge complements VSOs:
>
> 1. **While You Wait**: VSO appointments take 2-6 weeks. Start your claim prep TODAY with rallyforge, then bring your completed evidence packet to your VSO.
>
> 2. **Better Prepared = Faster Service**: VSOs appreciate when veterans arrive organized. You'll spend 30 minutes with your rep instead of 3 hours.
>
> 3. **Find What VSOs Miss**: Our AI scans for secondary conditions. Even experienced reps can overlook 3-5 linked conditions. Find them BEFORE your appointment.
>
> 4. **24/7 Access**: VSOs have office hours. rallyforge works at 2 AM when you can't sleep and want to research.
>
> 5. **Lifetime Learning**: Even after your claim is filed, you keep the knowledge and tools forever.
>
> **rallyforge + VSO = Best Outcome**

**Value**: Shows we're not anti-VSO, we're pro-veteran. Builds trust.

### PHASE 2: PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS (Month 2-3)

#### 6. **Build "Claim Readiness Score"**

**Purpose**: Gamification + self-assessment

**How It Works**:
- Veterans input their claim status
- AI calculates readiness score (0-100)
- Shows checklist of what's missing

**Example Output**:
```
Your Claim Readiness: 67/100 🟨 GOOD (but can improve)

✅ Completed:
  - Service records uploaded
  - Primary condition identified
  - 3 pieces of evidence collected
  - Theory of entitlement generated

⚠️ Needs Improvement:
  - Add buddy statements (+15 points)
  - Get private medical opinion (+10 points)
  - Document secondary conditions (+8 points)

🎯 Action Steps to Reach 100:
  1. Use our Buddy Statement template [Start →]

  3. Run Secondary Condition Finder [Analyze →]
```

**Value**:
- Clear action steps
- Progress tracking
- Motivates completion
- Shows value of premium tools

---

#### 7. **Add "Estimated Timeline to Decision"**

**Purpose**: Set realistic expectations

**Data Source**: VA processing times (publicly available)

**Example**:
> Based on your claim type (increase) and regional office (Boise), estimated timeline:
> - **Evidence gathering**: 2-4 weeks (you control this)
> - **Submission to acknowledgment**: 1-2 weeks
> - **Initial review**: 30-60 days
> - **C&P exam scheduling**: 45-90 days
> - **Decision**: 120-180 days from submission
>
> **Total**: 6-9 months on average
>
> 💡 **How to speed it up**:
> - Submit fully developed claim (all evidence upfront)
> - Use Decision Ready Claims (DRC) program
> - Respond to VA requests within 24-48 hours

**Value**: Manages expectations, reduces frustration

---

#### 8. **Create "Benefits Calculator Suite"**

**A. Total Financial Impact Calculator**
```
Based on your profile:
- Disability compensation: $3,500/month
- State property tax exemption: $125/month
- CHAMPVA for family: $400/month
- Chapter 35 (kid's college): $1,200/month (4 years)
- GI Bill transferred to spouse: $2,100/month (36 months)

TOTAL LIFETIME VALUE: $1.2 million
```

**B. "What If" Rating Calculator**
```
Your current rating: 70%
If you added these secondary conditions:
- Sleep apnea (50%) → New combined: 90%
- Depression (30%) → New combined: 100%

Income difference: $1,400/month = $16,800/year
```

**C. Effective Date Calculator**
```
Claim filed: Jan 15, 2024
Effective date: Jan 15, 2024 (AMA rule)
Decision date: Aug 20, 2024
Back pay owed: 7 months × $3,500 = $24,500

⚠️ If you delay filing:
- 6 months = $21,000 lost
- 1 year = $42,000 lost
- 2 years = $84,000 lost
```

**Value**: Shows MASSIVE financial impact, motivates action

---

#### 9. **Build "Evidence Gap Analyzer"**

**Purpose**: AI scans uploaded documents and identifies missing evidence

**How It Works**:
1. Veteran uploads medical records (PDF, images)
2. AI OCR extracts text
3. AI compares to 38 CFR rating criteria for their conditions

**Example Output**:
```
Analyzing your knee condition claim...

✅ Evidence Found:

  - Range of motion: 90 degrees (mentioned once)

❌ Missing Evidence for 30% Rating:
  - Range of motion measured during flare-up (38 CFR § 4.71a requires this)

  - Service connection nexus (IMO or DBQ)

🎯 Next Steps:
  1. Schedule appointment to measure ROM during flare-up
  2. Write lay statement about impact [Template →]
  3. Consider private IMO if service connection unclear [Find Doctor →]
```

**Value**: Veterans know EXACTLY what they're missing (vs guessing)

---

### PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES (Month 6-12)

#### 16. **Build "AI Claim Reviewer"**

**Purpose**: Veterans paste their claim draft, AI reviews for errors

**How It Works**:
1. Veteran writes claim statement
2. Pastes into AI reviewer
3. AI checks for:
   - Missing 38 CFR citations
   - Weak nexus language
   - Missing evidence references
   - Tone issues (too emotional vs factual)
   - Grammar/spelling errors
4. AI suggests improvements

**Example**:
```
Your Statement:
"My back hurts really bad every day and I can't work."

AI Feedback:
⚠️ Too vague - Specify frequency and intensity
⚠️ Missing service connection - How did this happen in service?
⚠️ No evidence cited - Reference medical records
✅ Suggested Rewrite:
"I experience chronic lower back pain (L4-L5) with daily flare-ups (8/10 pain scale)
that limit my ability to sit for more than 30 minutes, stand for more than 1 hour,
or lift more than 20 pounds. This condition is directly connected to my service as
an Infantryman (2010-2014), during which I carried 80+ lb rucksacks during
12-month deployment to Afghanistan. See attached: service medical records (Page 45,
dated March 2013) documenting initial back injury, and private medical opinion
from Dr. Smith (2024) establishing nexus to service."
```

**Value**: Dramatically improves claim quality, increases approval rates

- Specific examples of incidents you witnessed?

**AI Output**:
```
STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF CLAIM
Re: SGT John Doe, Service Number XXX-XX-XXXX

I, Michael Smith, make this statement in support of SGT John Doe's
VA disability claim for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

I have known SGT Doe since 2011, when we served together in the
82nd Airborne Division. I personally observed the following symptoms
beginning in 2012, following his deployment to Afghanistan:

1. Sleep Disturbances: SGT Doe frequently woke up screaming during
   night shifts. This occurred at least 3-4 times per week.

2. Hypervigilance: On multiple occasions, SGT Doe would hit the ground
   when hearing loud noises like car backfires or fireworks.

3. Social Withdrawal: Prior to deployment, SGT Doe was outgoing and
   enjoyed social events. After deployment, he declined all invitations
   and spent most free time alone in his room.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Signature: _________________ Date: _____________
Michael Smith, SSG (Retired), U.S. Army
Contact: (555) 123-4567
```

**Value**: Buddies don't know what to write—this guides them perfectly

---

#### 18. **Create "DBQ Assistant"**

**Purpose**: Help veterans prepare for DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire) completion

**How It Works**:
1. Veteran selects condition
2. AI shows the actual DBQ form for that condition
3. AI explains each question
4. AI provides example answers
5. Veteran brings this prep sheet to doctor appointment

**Example** (PTSD DBQ):
```
Section A: Criterion A (Traumatic Event)

Question 1: "Describe the traumatic event(s)"

What This Means:
The VA wants to know WHAT happened, WHEN, and WHERE.

Good Answer Example:
"On March 15, 2012, while on patrol in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan,
our convoy was hit by an IED. The vehicle in front of me was destroyed,
killing PFC Martinez and SPC Johnson, whom I had served with for 18 months.
I pulled SPC Davis from the burning vehicle with 2nd degree burns on my hands."

Bad Answer Example:
"I was in combat in Afghanistan."

Why It Matters:
Specific details = credibility. Vague answers get denied.
```

**Value**: Veterans get better DBQ results because they're prepared

---

#### 19. **Build "Medical Evidence Marketplace"**

**Purpose**: Connect veterans with private doctors who specialize in VA medical opinions

**How It Works**:
1. Veteran needs nexus letter or DBQ
2. Search by condition + location
3. See doctor profiles:
   - Experience with VA claims
   - Average turnaround time
   - Cost range ($500-$2,500)
   - Success rate (if available)
   - Reviews from other veterans
4. Book appointment through platform
5. rallyforge gets 10-15% referral fee

**Doctor Categories**:
- PTSD/Mental Health Specialists
- Orthopedic (back, knee, shoulder)
- TBI/Neurology
- Sleep Medicine (sleep apnea nexus)
- General IMO (Independent Medical Opinion)

**Revenue Potential**:
- 10,000 veterans × 50% need private opinion × $1,000 avg × 10% commission = $500K/year

---

#### 20. **Add "Employer Tax Credit Calculator"**

**Purpose**: Show employers financial incentive to hire veterans

**How It Works**:
1. Employer inputs veteran hire details
2. Calculator shows:
   - Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC): $2,400-$9,600
   - Disabled Veteran Tax Credit: Up to $9,600
   - State incentives (varies)
   - Estimated hiring cost offset: 30-40%

**Marketing Use**:
- Generate employer leads
- Position as "veteran hiring platform"
- Monetize job board ($50-$200 per posting)

**Value**: Creates B2B revenue stream

1. **Democratizing Access**: $50/year vs $3,000-$10,000
