# scanners/

This folder organizes all scanner-related modules, data, logs, and extracted files.

## Usage Guidelines
- Use subfolders for each scanner type (e.g., `dd214/`, `logs/`, `medical_records/`, `rating_decision/`, `str/`).
- Store only relevant data, code, or logs for each scanner type in its respective subfolder.
- Do not place general project files here.
- Add a README to each subfolder describing its purpose and usage.

## Example Contents
- `dd214/` - DD214 document scans and extracted data
- `logs/` - Scanner logs and diagnostics
- `medical_records/` - Medical record scans
- `rating_decision/` - Rating decision documents
- `str/` - Service Treatment Record scans

---

**Policy:** All data and code must be organized by scanner type and documented for traceability.
