1. Introduction

VeteranApp is a comprehensive, veteran-first digital ecosystem designed to empower veterans with clarity, accuracy, and confidence as they navigate the VA benefits landscape. This manual consolidates every conceptual, architectural, and operational component of the project into a single narrative reference.

It also provides a complete narrative description of the PowerShell automation required to bootstrap and validate the entire project structure - enabling Microsoft 365 Copilot to generate a safe, idempotent, self-healing script.

This document is the "book" version - a flowing, readable, conceptual guide.
