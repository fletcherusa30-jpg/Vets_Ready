# tools/

This folder is for custom project-specific tools, utilities, and helper binaries that are not general-purpose scripts.

## Usage Guidelines
- Place CLI utilities, code generators, or automation tools unique to this repo here.
- Do not store general build/deploy scripts (use scripts/ for those).
- Each tool should have a README or usage instructions in comments.

## Example Contents
- Python/Node.js/Go utilities for code generation, migration, or automation.
- Project-specific CLI wrappers.

**Policy:** All tools must be documented and reviewed before inclusion.
